#Writing Test Functions
Created a Python Project on PyCharm named (Adv_581_Revision)

Create a class (MathUtils)that performs four operations:add,subtract,multiply and divide

Create a Python test file named test_math_utils.py to test the methods of the MathUtils class.

Write test cases for each of the methods in the MathUtils class using pytest

Just typed the command (pytest) on command line to see the test results on Pycharm

Created a git repository on the local system using (git init) to initialise a repository.

Created a new repository on github 

Established connection of local repository to github using the command:(git remote add origin <repository_url>)
Verify if the connection is established:(git remote -v)
Then we do a command process to push the files into github after every change in files:
(git add .)
(git commit -m "message to be written")
(git push )

git branch (To view which branch we are currently on)
git checkout <branch_name> (to shift branch)
